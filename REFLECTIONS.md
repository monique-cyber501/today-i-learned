# 📘 Today I Learned (TIL): Cybersecurity & Software Development Journey

Welcome to my daily learning journal.

This space documents my growth as I pursue a career in cybersecurity—specifically as a future SOC Analyst with a focus on cloud and fintech security, while also pursuing software development to strengthen my overall technical foundation.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

Each entry includes:
- Daily notes from cybersecurity study and SOC-focused practice
- Core takeaways from software development concepts and projects
- Reflections on hands-on labs (TryHackMe, walkthroughs, CLI exercises)
- Progress updates from certification prep 
- Insights and study patterns that help me retain what I learn

## 🧱 Why Both Paths?

Understanding software development fundamentals gives me a stronger edge as a cybersecurity professional. This dual path:
- Builds my technical fluency across systems and code
- Sharpens problem-solving skills in real-world scenarios
- Prepares me to collaborate across teams in the tech stack

## 📌 Current Focus Areas

- Security+ (SY0-701) and Network+ (N10-009) prep  
- SOC workflows: alert triage, threat detection, incident response  
- Software development basics (version control, scripting, app structure)  
- Cloud security and platform fundamentals
