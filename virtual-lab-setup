###  Topic: Virtual Lab Setup & Static IP Configuration

**Today I learned how to:**
- Successfully install and configure a Windows 10 VM using VirtualBox
- Isolate the VM from my host network for safer security lab practices
- Manually assign a static IP address in Windows to support reliable VM identification during future simulations

**Key takeaways:**
- VirtualBox‚Äôs ‚ÄúInternal Network‚Äù mode is a great way to create a segmented lab environment that keeps traffic from touching the outside world ‚Äî a smart move for defensive cybersecurity training.
- Setting a static IP manually involves digging into the adapter settings and verifying with `ipconfig`, which reinforces networking fundamentals I‚Äôll rely on during log analysis and threat simulations.
- Taking screenshots and documenting each step not only builds my portfolio but helps reinforce retention.

**Challenges:**
- Had to troubleshoot access issues when navigating ISO downloads and system permissions
- Took extra care to censor sensitive network info before adding anything to my GitHub repo

**Next step:**
- Begin setting up Splunk on an Ubuntu VM and connect both machines for log forwarding practice
